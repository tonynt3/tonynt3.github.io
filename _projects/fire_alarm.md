As a part of this team, we investigated the security vulnerabilities of Honeywell’s SWIFT (Smart Wireless Integrated Fire Technology) wireless fire alarm system, with a focus on its RF and SLC gateway. Through firmware reverse engineering, AES encryption key recovery, and analysis of communication protocols, the research uncovered weaknesses in message parsing, data integrity checks, and bootloader security. The work also explored potential attack vectors—such as spoofed device messages and RF backdoors while designing a surrogate device to exploit these findings. The work with this project demonstrates advanced embedded systems analysis, reverse engineering, and cybersecurity assessment skills.
