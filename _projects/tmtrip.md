For Spring break of 2024, I was lucky to have the opportunity to travel to San Jose, Costa Rica and Panama City, Panama with many of my peers and professors through the Denning Technology and Management Program here at Georgia Tech. We spent the week not only establishing ourselves within Latin American culture, but also learning about the business practices that take place in other countries. Our group had the opportunity to visit companies such as Maersk, Dicarina, EnfraGen, The Toucan Rescue Ranch, and many more!

In Panama City, one of our visits included learning about one of the largest shipping and logistics companies in the world, Maersk. We were honored to have the President of Latin America and the Caribbean Region for A.P. Moller - Maersk, Se√±or Antonio Dominguez come and speak for us, as well as showing us around the office. It was great to learn about how Maersk has a goal of zero carbon emissions by 2040, and from what we saw, they are well on their way there. Maersk already has 12 green-methanol container ships (which have zero carbon emissions) on the water and plane to have 25 by the end of 2025. This is just an example of one of many visits that our group got to experience.

For this trip, students were divided up into groups for each visit, and my group was lucky to learn about the Toucan Rescue Ranch in Costa Rica. We were warmly welcomed by the Environmental Education Coordinator at the TRR, Stephanie Valle Cubero, who guided us through the ranch and introduced us to the fascinating world of wildlife conservation.

We saw sloths hanging from branches, toucans gracing the skies, agile wildcats, and mysterious owls. Every moment was a glimpse into the wonders of nature in Costa Rica. We also learned many facts about these animals, including how sloths move slowly to conserve energy, and how toucans have regenerative tongues. This was a wonderful and very educational experience that us students were very appreciative of.

Not only was this trip a great experience for us students, but a very educational learning experience. We met many CEO's, visited many coorporate buildings, and got to experience much of Latin American Culture. I am very proud to have been a part of this trip, and it is one I will definitely not forget.
