To begin my journey into the field of cybersecurity, I completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, an in-depth program covering the fundamentals of security principles, tools, and best practices. Through this coursework, I gained hands-on experience with topics such as network security, risk management, incident detection and response, and the use of security information and event management (SIEM) tools. The program strengthened my understanding of threat analysis, security hardening techniques, and compliance considerations, while also introducing me to Python and SQL for security-related tasks. This certification served as both a solid introduction to the field and a stepping stone toward more advanced credentials, including my goal of earning the CompTIA Security+ certification.
