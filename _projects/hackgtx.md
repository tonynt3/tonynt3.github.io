Due to my lack of project experience in late 2023, I decided to enter my first hackathon at Georgia Tech's HackGTX. I came in with no ideas or preparation, and then the 2 day timer started. When brainstorming, I lached onto two things. First of all, I wanted to create an IPhone app, as I knew it would be a very important skill and I had no idea how to create one. Secondly, I wanted to involve my interest of playing the guitar. Below is the README for this project:

Overall, this was a great experience, despite the app being basic. I went from not knowing what XCode was, to having a fully functional appliction running on my IPhone in the span of 48 hours. I hope to participate in more hackathons in the future, and push myself to learn so much in such a small amount of time.
