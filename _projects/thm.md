To start my journey of learning offensive security, and to prepare for my security based courses, I have resorted to TryHackMe to teach myself this information. TryHackMe has many different learning paths, targeted towards different careers, and I have been focusing mainly on security engineering basics, and introductory penetration testing. With the knowledge I have gained so far, I have been able to complete a few CTFs, and have been continuing to learn every day, as I am now working on the Offensive Pentesting learning path.

Through the Junior Penetration Tester pathway, I learned many practical skills needed to conduct penetration tests, such as using tools like Burpsuite, Metasploit, Nmap, and privilege escelation on linux and windows. This was a very exciting pathway, and I really enjoying using real exploits and becoming familiar with very important tools in the cybersecurity world.

In the web fundamentals learning pathway, I gained insight into important topics and frameworks of the cybersecurity industry, such as OWASP vulnerabilities, command injections, SQL injections, and much more. This was a very good introductory pathway for me to get started with real offensive security.

The pre security pathway was a necessary learning progression to get started with learning more about penetration testing. This pathway taught me fundamental knowledge in networking, such as LAN, the OSI model, packets, DNS, HTTP requests, and basic linux and windows OS terms.

Similar to the pre security pathway, the intro to cyber security learning path was crucial to learn the basics before moving on to penetration testing. This was a shorter learning path that established the differences of careers in cybersecurity, and red team versus blue team concepts.
