Never in a million years did I think that I would study abroad for 3 months in college, but thats what happened. Through Georgia Tech's GTE (Georgia Tech Europe) study abroad program, my friends and I had the opportunity to stay in Metz, France for the Summer of 2023, and take classes in person at the GTE building in Metz. Through this experience, it is safe to say that I learned a lot, and overcomed a good bit of adversity while I was at it. My group and I were able to travel to 12 different countries over this Summer, some including, Germany, Belgium, Hungary, Austria, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, and more, all while taking classes in person Monday through Thursday.

Unfortanely, I hit a pretty big roadbump midway through the Summer...

Long story short, if your knee ever looks abnormally large, go to the doctor before it gets infected. For context, I used to have many issues with my knee as a wrestler in high school, and unfortunately, these issues came back during this study abroad. My bursa sac on my right knee became infected, and I had to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks, continuing my classes online, and learning a lot of French from the nurses. Ultamitely, I ended up getting surgery to remove my bursa sac, and have now made a full recovery, at the cost of missing almost a month of my study abroad experience.

On a brighter note, I still had the ability to travel plenty before my incident.

Overall, I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. I learned a lot about different cultures, languages, and activites, and additionally completed 3 classes, getting a 4.0 for this semester, regardless of my detour to the hospital.
