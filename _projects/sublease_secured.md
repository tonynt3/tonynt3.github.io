To introduce my Product Development Class in Spring 2024, our professor tasked us with identifying and confirming a real and unsolved issue currently impacting the world some way or another. After months of interviewing and brainstorming, our group indentified and set out to solve the issue of college student subleasing. Every year, many students are left with no choice but to sign a year long lease for housing over the school year, but it is very common for these students to end up leaving campus for a semester for something like an internship, study abroad, or simply going home for the summer. Based on our analysis, the biggest current solution for Georgia Tech students to find a sublease or someone to take over their sublease is to advertise on social media platforms such as Facebook and GroupMe, but it is easy to understand how inefficient of a solution this is, and that is where our team decided to step in.

After much research and trail and error, our team decided that a web-application would be the ideal solution to this issue. Our initial objective was to create a software that connected students that were looking for a sublease, but upon further investigation, we realized that the issue goes beyond connectivity. Our final product displays a software that authenticates users as college students, and gives them the option to connect with other students, as well as doing some of the backend work by creating a contract that makes the subleasing process SECURE and legal. Below you can see the UI for the home page of our Webapp.

Using the React framework and Tailwind CSS, our team developed this application with 3 suplimmental pages, "Find a Sublease", "Lease your Apartment", and "Generate Contract". The page for finding a sublease was intended to be a page similar to AirB&B's UI for finding temporary places to stay, we incorperated a simple search feature and a short list of example listings for the user to browse through.

Most importantly, the contract generation page, which uses a JavaScript backend to replace user input and information into the premeditated subleasing contract, is used to make the subleasing process reliable and secure for users. An issue we found during the research phase of this cycle was that students were unsure if they would be garunteed their money and safety of their apartment, which was a problem we hope to solve with this contract generator seen below.

Upon the end of the semester, we had to present our idea and demonstrate our prototype to fellow students, professors, and coorporate affiliates of the Denning Technology and Management Program. After the semester of hard work and many obstacles, our group was very excited to win the award for most fundable project, which was voted on by the audience which we presented to.

The development of this application is still in progress, and our group is currently working on using DUO Mobile's API to create a trustworthy authentication process for users that intend to use our product. Upon completion of this, we hope to take our product to Georgia Tech's CreateX Startup Launch program, and hope to recieve funding and host the website for users. Although our product is not complete, we have finished the product development class with this idea, and showcased it to many other, where we gathered much support and feedback. The creation of this has been a great learning experience and I am excited to see where this takes us.
