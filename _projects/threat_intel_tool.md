To conclude the Denning T&M Program, I was placed on a capstone team to work with a risk3sixty to identify and solve a problem within the company. Our team created a tool that generates routine cyber threat assessment reports for companies interested in strengthening their cybersecurity environment. A company will fill out a profile page that will guide the tool to scrape relevant information from six open-source intelligence sites and generate a personalized report enhanced by artificial intelligence. The tool is hosted on a webpage connected to risk3sixty's website and is free of charge for users. Companies can request automatic updated reports be emailed to the firm on a routine basis and the report fulfills cybersecurity compliance requirements such as ISO 27001 5.7A. This tool supports small-to-medium sized firms in understanding how to improve their security and prevent vulnerabilities and threat actors.
