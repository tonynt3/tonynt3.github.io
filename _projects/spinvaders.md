As an assignmnet for my Computer Organization & Programming class (CS2110), my assignment was to create a game using the programming language C and Game Boy Advance to run the game. Throughout this class, we progressed from learning machine code, to assembly code, to C, and in this assignment, I used my comprehensive understanding of these topics to recreate the game "Space Invaders" in my spinoff "Spinvaders".

Although this game was quite simple to create, it was a great learning experience and helped me better understand memory allocation, DMA, GDB, VBlank, and overall C comprehension.
