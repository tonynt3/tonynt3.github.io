The John and Nellie Wooden Leadership Conference, held in Oxford, Ohio, is a beacon of inspiration for emerging leaders. Attending on behalf of Beta Theta Pi fraternity was a transformative experience, immersing me in the wisdom of renowned leaders and the ethos of excellence espoused by the Woodens. Drawing from their timeless principles of integrity, character, and servant leadership, the conference instilled in me a profound sense of purpose and direction. Now, as the Vice President of Recruitment for Beta Theta Pi, I strive to embody the ethos of the Wooden Leadership Conference, fostering a culture of empowerment, growth, and service within my fraternity.
