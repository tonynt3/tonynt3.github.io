The Southeastern Greek Leadership Association conference, held in Atlanta, Georgia, served as a nexus for Greek organizations to foster leadership and community engagement. As the Administrative Vice President for Georgia Tech's Interfraternity Council, I had the privilege of attending this impactful event. Throughout the conference, I actively engaged in workshops, discussions, and networking sessions aimed at enhancing organizational efficiency, promoting inclusivity, and cultivating leadership skills within the Greek community. This experience not only enriched my understanding of effective leadership but also provided valuable insights to implement within our council, fostering a stronger, more cohesive fraternity community at Georgia Tech.
