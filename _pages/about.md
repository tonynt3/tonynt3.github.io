Hi, I'm Tony, a student at Georgia Tech, pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science, specializing in Information Internetworks and Cybersecurity, with a minor in Computing and Business through the Denning Technology & Management Program.

I have a strong interest in the Cybersecurity field, especially areas such as penetration testing and vulnerability research, which I now spend my free time trying to learn. Outside of this, I enjoy playing electric guitar, Clash of Clans, and golf.

Additionally, I've studied abroad (twice), and have completed a few projects which you can learn more about [here](/projects/).

Feel free to reach out to me with the links at the bottom of this page!
