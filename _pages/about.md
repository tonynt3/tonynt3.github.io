Hi, I'm Tony, a student at Georgia Tech, pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science, specializing in Information Internetworks and Cybersecurity, with a minor in Computing and Business through the Denning Technology & Management Program.

When I'm not buried in code or grinding in the library, I may be working on my leadership skills as VP of Recruitment for Beta Theta Pi Fraternity or handling administrative duties as Administrative VP for the Interfraternity Council, which you can learn more about [here](/al-folio/leadership/).

Additionally, I've studied abroad (twice), and have completed a few projects which you can learn more about [here](/al-folio/projects/).

Feel free to reach out to me with the links at the bottom of this page!
